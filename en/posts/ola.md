# Hey! :)

My name is Bruno Geronimo.

I decided to create a blog to share things I learned over time. I think the main focus of this blog will be IT, but the idea is to talk about anything I think is worth to be shared. Starting from programming to security on the web, privacy, utilities, etc.

I'm also open for suggestions, if you have one. Just ping me on [Telegram](https://t.me/brunogeronimo) to suggest any topic you want me to talk more about. :)

P.S.: The current site theme is temporary. I just wanted to put something live and adapt it over time.
