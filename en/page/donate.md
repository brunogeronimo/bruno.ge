Hey!

This blog is 100% free of charge. I won't add any sort of paywall. My goal is to share the knowledge I learned since I became 
a developer.

Also, I do not use any analysis tool, such as Google Analytics. Due to that, this blog has no 
"privacy/use of cookies policy", as no personal data is collected and no 3rd party cookies are currently in use.

I'll be very happy if you want/can collaborate with this project. :)

Today I accept donations via the following methods:

* Paypal: https://paypal.me/brunogeronimo
* GitHub Sponsors: https://github.com/sponsors/brunogeronimo
