# Content for [bruno.ge]

_VersÃ£o em portuguÃªs disponÃ­vel [aqui](README.md)._

This repository contains all original Markdown files used on [bruno.ge]. The idea is to keep all the content in an
open-source way, while the build and deployment settings are kept in a different private repository.

All drafts and published posts are available here. On [issues], you can also check what is currently in progress.
Every issue is linked with its respectives branches, in both English and Portuguese versions.

Feel free to suggest contents by creating [issues] as well, if you wish. ðŸ™‚
